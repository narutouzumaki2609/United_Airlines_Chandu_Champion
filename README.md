Project Title: Quick Answers, Happy Customers: Revolutionizing United Airlines' Call Center

Overview
This repository contains a series of analyses and experiments aimed at optimizing key call center metrics, such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST), and improving customer experience using various machine learning and data analysis techniques. The goal is to identify inefficiencies and provide actionable recommendations based on customer sentiment, agent performance, and call reasons. Additionally, we experiment with deep learning models to predict call reasons based on transcripts.
